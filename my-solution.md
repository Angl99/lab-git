```

## 3

Check the current status of the git repository.

Copy and paste the _output_ of the command(s) you ran into the code block below.

## 6

Add the following text to your `readme.md` file.

```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   readme.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   readme.md
```

## 7

Commit your changes and include a sensible commit message. Then, check your repository's history.

Copy and paste _the command(s)_ you used into the code block below.

```
git commit -m "added readme"
```

## 8

Check the current status of the git repository.

Copy and paste the _output_ of the command(s) you ran into the code block below.

```
On branch main
